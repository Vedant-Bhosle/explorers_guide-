It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old fort.
  Mysore is one of the major cities in the South Indian state of Karnataka. Till independence it was the capital city of Wodeyars, the erstwhile Maharajas of Mysore. At a distance of 140 kms from Bangalore, Mysore has always enchanted tourists and visitors with its magnificent palaces, beautiful gardens and rich cultural heritage. The city is famous for its silk and is also a thriving sandalwood and incense center. Today, Mysore has become a major tourist destination because of its convenient size and good climate, moreover the city has chosen to retain and promote its heritage rather than replace it.

<h4 class="container">* city palace</h4>
<img id="imgplaces" class="img-fluid" src="/citypalacejaipur.jpg" alt="">
<p class="paraplaces">City Palace has stood at the heart of the Old City of Jaipur for nearly three centuries, shortly after Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II decided to relocate his court from the city of Amber. Protected by huge guard walls, the fairy-tale-like structure is still the home of Jaipur's modern-day royal family, and is more extravagant and enchanting than you might imagine.
  City Palace is more than a sand-colored regal abode—it's a sprawling complex of buildings built around a series of landscaped garden courtyards overlooking Jaipur and Lake Palace. The entire property is a stunning display of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture.
  The current occupants reside in the most eye-catching building, the Chandra Mahal, an elegant structure with curved eaves and domed rooftops. Each of its seven stories features an entirely different style. The ground floor is included in the price of admission, but you'll need to book a private tour to go upstairs.
  Other noteworthy places for sightseeing at City Palace include the Mubarak Mahal (Welcome Palace), which contains displays of dazzling costumes and textiles; the Armoury, a museum-like space dedicated to preserving finely crafted daggers and swords; Pritam Niwas Chowk (Peacock Courtyard), which has mesmerizing doorways painted to look like the feathers of its namesake bird; and Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience), which showcases the palace's exquisite collection of miniature paintings.
  After exploring the palace, check out the Friends of the Museum Bazaar—it has some of Jaipur's highest quality souvenirs (with equally high prices).

<h4 class="container">* Amber Fort</h4>
<img id="imgplaces" class="img-fluid" src="/Amber_Fort_.jpg" alt="">
<p class="paraplaces">Jaipur is home to one of India's most-visited forts: Amber Fort. Built in the year 1592, the sandstone and marble monolith stands atop a small hill roughly 20 minute's driving distance northeast of the center of Jaipur. It's best known for being a pristine example of Rajasthani architecture.
  Getting to Amber Fort typically involves a short uphill hike that's well worth the effort. It's decked out with intricate patterns of inlaid marble in nearly every color of the rainbow. The fort is laid out into four separate sections, each of which has a spectacular garden courtyard outside. While you'd never know it from above, you can actually explore the fort's underground tunnels, some of which have been restored.
  This UNESCO World Heritage Site has a fascinating history of legends, betrayals, and romance—but the best way for tourists to hear these stories is to hire a private guide at the Amber Fort.

            <p className="paraplaces">The Taj Mahal was built by Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died in 1631 while giving birth to their 14th child. Mumtaz, Shah Jahan’s third wife, was known for her exceptional beauty, and the emperor was known to be mad about her. Crestfallen by her sudden death, the emperor, it is believed, turned grey-haired in just one night. Work on the Taj began in 1632, but it wasn’t until 1653 that the whole monument came together in its current form. But as fate would have it, soon after the Taj was built Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son Aurangazeb who held him prisoner in the Agra Fort, where he spent the rest of his years yearning for the Taj. Shah Jahan after his death in 1666 was buried beside his beloved Mumtaz in the Taj Mahal.
                A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983 for being the “jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”, an army of 20,000 artisans from across India, Central Asia and Europe were employed to work on the Taj.

                <p className="paraplaces">The Agra Fort, also known as the “Lal –Qila”, “Fort Rouge” or “Qila-i-Akbari”, is the highlight of the city of Agra, then capital of the Mughal Sultanate . The entry to Agra Fort is allowed through the Amar Singh Gate only. Some portion of this fort is used by the Indian Army. The public access to that part has been prohibited. So you can not see that area.
                    However as this fort is very expansive and contains many buildings that are worth a visit so you can very well check them out.
                    On visiting the Agra Fort, you will come across Diwan-i-Am or the Hall of Public Audience. This hall with numerous pillars is said to be erected by Shah Jahan in the year 1628. On heading little forward, you will see Royal Pavilions abounding in elegant mosques including Nagina Masjid and Mina Masjid, palaces like Macchi Bhavan, Khas Mahal, Shish Mahal and Shah Jahani Mahal and the Zenana Mina Bazaar.
